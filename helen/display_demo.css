DISPLAY:
<section class="box inline"> - appears as small inline boxes on same line.
<section class="box inline-block"> - appears as a full length boxes on different lines that span all the way to the end and don't respect the body's margin.
<section class="box block"> - appears as a full length box that has a margin.
<section class="box none">
*/

/*
UNITS:
Don't use px for font. At least use pt if not em/rem.
em and rem are weird-
em focuses on the parent container, so whatever the parent is, 1em will do e.g. 1x the font.
rem focuses on the root, e.g. the Body. It will ignore the parent.
So use rem not em where possible. It's less messy.
*/

/*
WIDTH AND HEIGHT:
<section class="box px-height"> - sets pixels.
<section class="box vw-width"> - vw is viewport.
<section class="box %-width">
Use vw where possible because it respects the margins.

<section class="box px-height"> 
<section class="box vw-height"> - goes full length of body.
<section class="box %-height"> - 

Use vh if you have an aside that you want to go all the way down.
*/

/*OTHER NOTES:
-Always set a global font size in the body. And a font family.
