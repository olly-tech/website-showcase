# First Website
 
This is the first website I have created on the MadLab Intro to Web Development course.

This Mark Down File will also serve as a place to practice my Markdown Syntax.

# One Hash is a First-Level Heading.
## Two Hash is a Second-Level Heading.
### Three Hash is a Third-Level Heading.

**Two Asterix is Bold Text.** or __double underscore.__
*One Asterix is Italics.* or _single underscore._
~~Two tilde is Strikethrough~~

> Right Angle Bracket is a Quote.

`Back Ticks` make text appear as code, and it will change the appearance of the contained words.

```Triple Backticks``` creates a block of code.
