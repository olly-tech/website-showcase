                    <p>Uncharted 1 was released in 2007 by Naughty Dog. It was a decent game but not the best one they did. Nathan and Sully go on an aventure when they meet Journalist Elena, and together, they have to shoot bad guys to find the treasure first.</p>

                    <p>Uncharted 2 was released in 2009 by Naughty Dog. For many Uncharted fans, this game is considered one of the best games in the series. Joined by Elena again, Nathan and Sully go on another adventure and have to shoot more bad guys.</p>

                    <h2>Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</h2>
                    <p>Uncharted 3 was released in 2011 by Naughty Dog. This game wasn't as well-received as its predecessor, but it is massively underrated game and if you don't like it, you need to try harder. In a shocking revelation that's never been done before, we see Nathan, along with Elena and Sully, try to find some ancient treasure wilst not being shot by the competition.</p>

                    <h2>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</h2>
                    <p>Uncharted 4 was released in 2016 by Naughty Dog. This is the best game they made and any other opinion is incorrect. Maybe it's nostalgia for me because it was the first one I played, but why the f would you not love a game based around Pirates?!!! In this fantastic twist on the usual Uncharted games, Nathan Drake is joined by his long lost big brother on a quest to find a long lost civilisation and Pirate Tr... Gold! And of course, they get shot at by bad guys.</p>

                    <h2>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</h2>
                    <p>Unhcharted Lost Legacy was released in 2017 by, you guessed it, Naughty Dog. It was a pretty cool game because it was a bit more open world than we've seen previously, and had some cool moments. But it's not gonna overtake Uncharted 4 for me. You may wonder why it's not called Uncharted 5... Well, it's because Nathan drake hung up his adventurer hat, and so the duty passes to Uncharted 2's side friend character Chloe, with the help of Uncharted 4's villain character Nadine, to continue her father's legacy to find more treasure and lost cities.</p>
