        1. Unnecessary Commented Code
You have several commented-out sections (<style>, <nav>, <img>, etc.). If they're no longer needed, consider removing them to clean up the code.

2. HTML Syntax Issues
There is a stray </tsp> tag inside the commented-out <nav>. Since <tsp> is not a valid HTML tag, you should remove it.

The <p> tag inside <section class="moreinfo"> is incorrectly closed after the section ends:

html
Copy
Edit
</section>
</p> <!-- This closing tag shouldn't be here -->
Fix: Move </p> inside the <section> or remove it.

3. Improve Accessibility (a11y)
The nav menu should have a role="navigation" attribute for better screen reader support:

html
Copy
Edit
<nav role="navigation">
Use semantic <header> and <footer> instead of <div class="header">. Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<header class="header">
The <h1> should be the main page heading, and you should avoid skipping heading levels.

4. Add alt Attributes to All Images
Your main logo <img> has an alt attribute, but images inside sections like:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="images/autisk_img1.jpg" alt="Autisk Building">
Consider making these alt texts more descriptive for accessibility.

5. Improve Readability
Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces per level).

The <aside> is currently placed inside <main>, which isn't best practice. Move it outside <main>:

html
Copy
Edit
<aside>...</aside> 
<footer>...</footer> 
6. Use a More Descriptive <title>
The <title> is "Autisk", which could be expanded for better SEO:

html
Copy
Edit
<title>Autisk - Support for Families with Additional Needs</title>
7. Use rel="noopener noreferrer" in External Links
For security and performance, modify external links like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="https://signpostforcarers.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

Weekly Events.html code review

1. Unnecessary Commented-Out Code
You have a lot of commented-out sections (e.g., within <section>, <img>, and <p> tags). If they are no longer needed, consider removing them to improve readability.

Example:
html
Copy
Edit
<!-- No diagnosis is needed to join our groups as we are very aware that it is hard on the pathway to diagnosis.
<br>
We have a fully functional sensory room that can be accessed for free via our social groups.
-->
ðŸ”¹ Suggested Fix: Remove commented-out code unless you plan to use it soon.

2. Navigation: Duplicate class="active"
You have assigned the class="active" to two menu items (About Us and Weekly Events).

Issue:
html
Copy
Edit
<li><a href="index.html" class="active">About us</a></li>
<li><a href="Weeklyevents.html" class="active">Weekly Events</a></li>
ðŸ”¹ Suggested Fix:
Only one item should have class="active" at a time.

html
Copy
Edit
<li><a href="index.html" class="active">About us</a></li>
<li><a href="Weeklyevents.html">Weekly Events</a></li>
If you want to dynamically highlight the active page, consider using JavaScript or backend logic instead.

3. Misplaced </p> Tag
You have this closing tag outside the <section>, which is incorrect:

html
Copy
Edit
</section>
</p>  <!-- This closing tag is unnecessary -->
ðŸ”¹ Suggested Fix: Move or remove it.

html
Copy
Edit
</section>
4. Accessibility: Missing <header>
Right now, your header content is inside a <div class="header">. It's better to use the semantic <header> tag.

Before:
html
Copy
Edit
<div class="header">
  <img src="images/Autisk.jpg" class="imgclass" alt="Autisk"/>
  <h1 class="titleHeader">Autisk</h1>
</div>
After (Better for SEO & Accessibility):
html
Copy
Edit
<header class="header">
  <img src="images/Autisk.jpg" class="imgclass" alt="Autisk Logo"/>
  <h1 class="titleHeader">Autisk</h1>
</header>
5. Use rel="noopener noreferrer" for Security
Whenever you open a new tab (target="_blank"), add rel="noopener noreferrer" for security and performance.

Before:
html
Copy
Edit
<a href="https://www.autisk.co.uk/" target="_blank">Press Here</a>
After (More Secure):
html
Copy
Edit
<a href="https://www.autisk.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Press Here</a>
This prevents tab hijacking and improves security.

6. <aside> Placement
Your <aside> is inside <main>, but it's typically better placed outside <main>, as it is not part of the main content.

Before:
html
Copy
Edit
<main>
  ...
  <aside>
    <h3>Other Useful Links</h3>
    <p>...</p>
  </aside>
</main>
After (Better Structure):
html
Copy
Edit
<main>
  ...
</main>

<aside>
  <h3>Other Useful Links</h3>
  <p>...</p>
</aside>
This improves HTML semantics.

7. Improve Footer Readability
Your footer contains address and contact info, but it's all inside a single <p>.
Break it into separate lines for better readability.

Before:
html
Copy
Edit
<footer>
  <p>
    Copyright 2025 Autisk.co.uk - All Rights Reserved. <br>
    Adswood Young People's Centre <br>
    Neston Grove<br>
    Adswood, Stockport <br>
    SK3 8PH <br>
    Email : enquiry@autisk.co.uk - Telephone : 07376 341092
  </p>
</footer>
After (Better Formatting):
html
Copy
Edit
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2025 Autisk.co.uk - All Rights Reserved.</p>
  <address>
    Adswood Young People's Centre, Neston Grove, Adswood, Stockport, SK3 8PH
  </address>
  <p>
    Email: <a href="mailto:enquiry@autisk.co.uk">enquiry@autisk.co.uk</a> | 
    Phone: <a href="tel:+447376341092">07376 341092</a>
  </p>
</footer>
This makes:

Email clickable (mailto link).

Phone number clickable (tel link).

8. Improve <div class="cards-grid"> for Better Layout
Your event cards are inside <div class="cards-grid">, but you haven't specified a CSS grid or flexbox layout. If they look misaligned, make sure you have this in styles.css:

css
Copy
Edit
.cards-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}

.card {
  background: #f5f5f5;
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}
This makes the cards:

Responsive (auto-fit columns).

Well-spaced (gap: 20px).

Styled with padding & rounded corners.
