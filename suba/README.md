# New Website
 
This is the first website I have created in madlab Web Development Course

This mark down file will also serve as a place to practice my markdown syntax

# A first-level heading

## A second level heading

### A third-level heading

**this text is bold**

*this is italic text*

~~this is strikethrough text~~

>This text is a quote

To make text appear as code we use `back ticks` and it will change the appearance of the contained words

```triple backticks creates a block of code```
