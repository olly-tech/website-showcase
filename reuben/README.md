# MadLab
 MadLab Course Repo Test

This is the first website I have created on the MadLab Intro to Web Development Course.
This mark down file will also serve as a place to practice markdown syntax

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

**this text is bold**
*this is italic text*
~~this is strikethrough text~~

>This text is a quote

To make text appear as code we use ` back ticks ` and it will change the appearance of the contained words

```triple backticks creates a block of code```
