    <h3>Towns and Cities</h3>
    <ul>
      <!-- Baldur's Gate -->
      <li>
        <h3>Baldur's Gate: The City of Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
          A city of wealth, corruption, and endless ambition, Baldur’s Gate is as dangerous as it is prosperous. From the Lower City’s bustling docks to the opulent manors of the Upper City, every street holds the promise of fortune—or misfortune—for those who dare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities for Adventurers:
          <ul>
            <li>Test Your Luck in the Outer City – The law holds less sway beyond the city gates, and those with a taste for gambling, smuggling, or pit fighting will find ample opportunity.</li>
            <li>Investigate the Undercellar – A network of secret tunnels and shadowed dealings lies beneath the streets. Who operates within? And what truths—or lies—can be uncovered there?</li>
            <li>Defend the Merchant Caravans – Goods flow constantly in and out of the city, but the roads are treacherous. The right employer may offer fair coin for a blade and a keen eye.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <li>
        <h3>Neverwinter: The Jewel of the North</h3>
        <p>
          Once nearly lost to ruin, Neverwinter has reclaimed its glory, standing proud as one of the finest cities on the Sword Coast. Its streets hum with industry, its people strive for prosperity, and its walls hold firm against the dangers of the North.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities for Adventurers:

            <li>Brave the Chasm’s Legacy – Though sealed by magic, remnants of the terrible rift that once split the city may still harbor dangers—or opportunities—for the daring.</li>
            <li>Seek Work from the Mercantile Guilds – Trade in Neverwinter is thriving, and many seek strong arms and sharp minds to guard caravans or uncover rare goods.</li>
          </ul>

      <li>
        <h3>Waterdeep: The City of Splendors</h3>
        <p>
          Few places in Faerûn rival Waterdeep in majesty and intrigue. This vast metropolis is a place of high culture, arcane wonders, and veiled conspiracies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities for Adventurers:

            <li>Navigate the Noble Houses – Waterdeep’s masked lords and merchant dynasties are always in need of skilled agents, whether for diplomacy or deception.</li>
            <li>Unravel the City’s Secrets – With enough coin or cunning, one might uncover lost histories, clandestine dealings, or arcane mysteries hidden in plain sight.</li>

      <!-- Luskan -->
      <li>
        <h3>Luskan: The City of Sails</h3>
        <p>
          A rough and rowdy port where pirates once ruled, Luskan remains a city where only the strong—or the shrewd—survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities for Adventurers:
          <ul>
            <li>Tread Carefully in the Arcane Brotherhood’s Shadow – The mages who govern Luskan are ever watchful, and their secrets are not easily uncovered.</li>
            <li>Take to the High Seas – Many a crew seeks bold adventurers to fend off sea monsters, rival pirates, or worse.</li>
            <li>Hunt for the Remnants of the Pirate Lords – The old pirate kings may be gone, but rumors whisper of their hidden treasures.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Elturel: The Land of the Shining Light</h3>
        <p>
          A realm unlike any other, Elturgard is ruled not by kings or lords but by the holy light of the Companion, an eternal radiance that banishes darkness and undeath.
