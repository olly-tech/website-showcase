# Code Review (AI)

A code review of my website conducted by AI. Practicing using AI to support my programming development. This is the output:

## AI Output

### HTML

 1. Doctype & HTML Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is correct for HTML5.

<html lang="en-gb"> is good; however, typically, en-GB (British English) is used. While en-gb isn’t technically wrong, using the lowercase en-GB is more consistent with standards.

2. Meta Tags
The <meta charset="utf-8"> tag is correct for setting the character encoding.

The viewport meta tag is essential for responsiveness, so great job including it.

The description and keywords meta tags are helpful for SEO, but make sure they accurately reflect the content of the page for better results.

Consider adding an author meta tag for completeness, e.g.:

html
Copy
<meta name="author" content="Your Name or Organization">
3. Title Tag
The title, <title>In&Around Stockport</title>, is appropriate, but consider removing the ampersand (&) in the title as it can be represented in an HTML-safe way (&amp;).

4. Favicon
The favicon link looks fine, but ensure that the favicon.PNG image is indeed a PNG file. If it’s an icon, consider using .ico format for broader compatibility, but PNG should work too.

5. Header Section
The header is simple and includes an image with the class logo. You might want to add alt text to the <img> tag for accessibility, e.g.:

html
Copy
<img src="images/logo.PNG" class="logo" alt="In&Around Stockport Logo">
6. Navigation (Nav)
The <nav> element is used correctly, and the list of links seems well-organized.

Accessibility: The link with the class active should ideally be dynamically generated (e.g., via JavaScript) for better maintainability, but it’s okay for now.

For accessibility, you could consider adding aria-label to some sections to describe their purpose for screen readers. For example:

html
Copy
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
7. Main Content Section
The use of <section> inside the <main> element is great for organizing content.

For accessibility, it’s better to use <h1> in your document for the main title, but I understand if that’s reserved for the page's main heading or if it's elsewhere in your layout.

The repeated Find out more... text links could use a little more context for accessibility. You can add more descriptive text within the link, or better, use a button element if the interaction is more of a "clickable action." For example:

html
Copy
<a href="town.html">Learn more about Stockport Town Centre</a>
8. Image Elements
Each image should include descriptive alt text for accessibility. This is especially important for users who rely on screen readers or when the images fail to load. Example:

html
Copy
<img src="images/market.webp" alt="Market in Stockport Town Centre">
Also, ensure that all your images are optimized for size and loading speed (e.g., using WebP for modern browsers).

9. Footer
The footer seems to work fine. It’s great to see a copyright notice included.

You could consider adding a link to a privacy policy or terms of service if applicable.

10. JavaScript and External File Linking
You correctly linked to script.js at the end of the document. This is a good practice, as it ensures that the DOM is fully loaded before any JavaScript is executed.

If you have specific functionality or interactivity, make sure your JavaScript file is efficient and non-blocking.

11. General Comments
Indentation and Formatting: Your code formatting looks clean, and indentation is consistent. Make sure to maintain this throughout the rest of your project.

SEO Considerations: It might be a good idea to use heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) appropriately. For example, in your <main>, make sure your headings reflect a proper hierarchy (<h2> for sections, and you can use <h1> for the main page title).

Accessibility: As mentioned earlier, including alt text for images and potentially adding aria-* attributes where necessary would help make your site more accessible to a wider range of users.

Conclusion
Your HTML structure looks solid! The main improvements I'd suggest are:

Alt Text: Add descriptive alt text to all images.

Improve Link Descriptions: Make the text in links more descriptive for accessibility.

Semantic HTML: Consider using appropriate heading tags and improving the semantic structure.

Favicon: Make sure the favicon is accessible and working as expected.

### CSS

General Comments:
Consistency & Readability: Your CSS is easy to read and well-structured. Good use of spacing and comments (though some could help clarify what certain styles are meant to do).

Variables (Optional): You could use CSS variables to improve maintainability. For example, define the main color (#124E91) and background colors in variables so it’s easier to update across the entire stylesheet.

Body
Looks good, especially with the line-height for readability.

Consider switching to a more modern font stack for better typography across devices. For example:

Header
Background: You’re using both background-image and background-color, which could conflict if the image doesn't load. Consider removing the background-color: #fff; if the image is the primary background.

If the image is critical for the header, ensure that it works well with various screen sizes. For a better fallback, consider adding background-size: cover; to make sure it covers the header area fully.

.header Class
Flexbox: It seems like you're planning to use flexbox here, but you need to ensure you’ve set up the parent container to be a flex container. Add display: flex; to the .header class.

Logo
This works, but make sure the logo image size is controlled, otherwise it could stretch if the image is not resized appropriately.

Navigation
This is good! You might want to add align-items: center; to vertically center the nav items:

Dropdown Menu
This works well for showing the dropdown, but you might want to add a transition to make the menu appear smoother.

Main Content Grid
The grid layout is good for a basic three-column layout. To improve for responsiveness, consider using a media query to adjust the grid on smaller screens:

Grid Sections
Color Contrast: The background color #d8d8e8 is light, which can be hard to read if the text color is too light. Consider darkening this color slightly or ensuring there’s enough contrast.

Image Handling
This is great for responsiveness. You could also add object-fit: cover; to ensure images fill their containers without stretching.

Footer
The footer is clean and simple, but consider increasing the padding slightly for more breathing room.

Form
Color: Cadet Blue is a bit subdued. If it’s not part of the overall design, consider a more neutral color or ensuring it complements the other elements.

For accessibility, consider adding outline: none; to remove default focus outlines and use custom styles instead for better visibility of focused form elements.

.quizgnome
Float: Using float for layout isn’t as common nowadays, as Flexbox and Grid have become the preferred methods. You might want to switch this to display: flex; or position: absolute; depending on the desired behavior.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Responsive Design: Your grid system can be made more responsive using media queries (as noted).

Flexbox: Consider switching to flexbox in places where float is used (.quizgnome), as it’s more modern and flexible.

Variables: Use CSS variables for common values (like colors) to make the styles easier to maintain.

Transitions: Add transitions (e.g., for dropdown menus, links) to create a smoother user experience.

Contrast and Readability: Ensure enough contrast between text and background colors, especially for accessibility.

### JS

1. General Observations
Code Duplication: You have five functions (rock(), paper(), scissors(), lizard(), spock()) that are very similar. Each function repeats the same structure, with only the yourPick value changing. This could be simplified to avoid repetition.

Suggestion: You could consolidate the logic into one generalized function by passing yourPick as an argument. Here's an approach:

javascript
Copy
function playGame(yourPick) {
    const choices = ["Rock", "Scissors", "Paper", "Lizard", "Spock"];
    const compPick = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * 5)];
    console.log(compPick);

    if (compPick === yourPick) {
        alert(`DRAW! The computer also picked ${yourPick}! Play again?`);
    } else {
        const outcomes = {
            Rock: ["Scissors", "Lizard"],
            Scissors: ["Paper", "Lizard"],
            Paper: ["Rock", "Spock"],
            Lizard: ["Paper", "Spock"],
            Spock: ["Rock", "Scissors"]
        };

        if (outcomes[yourPick].includes(compPick)) {
            alert(`You Win! The computer picked ${compPick}! Play again?`);
        } else {
            alert(`You Lose! The computer picked ${compPick}! Play again?`);
        }
    }
}
Then you can replace the individual functions (rock(), paper(), etc.) with:

javascript
Copy
function rock() { playGame("Rock"); }
function paper() { playGame("Paper"); }
function scissors() { playGame("Scissors"); }
function lizard() { playGame("Lizard"); }
function spock() { playGame("Spock"); }
This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to maintain.

2. Quiz Check Logic
The checkAnswers() function uses quiz.bear.value, quiz.beets.value, etc., which is fine, but it’s assuming the form is always named Quiz and the form fields have specific names. If the names of the form fields change, this will break.

Suggestion: Use a more dynamic approach to accessing form values, like storing them in an object or using querySelector if the form structure changes.

Example:

javascript
Copy
function checkAnswers() {
    let score = 0;
    const answers = {
        bear: "black",
        beets: "battlestar",
        ducks: 20
    };

    for (const [question, correctAnswer] of Object.entries(answers)) {
        const userAnswer = document.querySelector(`input[name=${question}]`).value;
        if (userAnswer == correctAnswer) {
            score++;
        }
    }

    alert(`Well done! Your score was ${score}`);
}
3. Clicker Game Logic
Your clicker game logic looks good! You're correctly updating the score, upgrading levels, and handling button clicks. One small suggestion is to ensure the user can't keep clicking the "Buy Upgrade" button indefinitely without further feedback when the cost becomes prohibitive.

Suggestion: Consider disabling the "Buy Upgrade" button once the user no longer has enough points to afford it:

javascript
Copy
upgradeButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (score >= upgradeCost) {
        score -= upgradeCost;
        upgradeLevel++;
        clickValue++;
        upgradeCost = Math.floor(upgradeCost * 1.5);
        updateScore();
        updateUpgrade();
    } else {
        alert("Not enough points to upgrade!");
    }
});
Also, keep the button disabled visually when the user can't afford the upgrade:

javascript
Copy
function updateUpgrade() {
    upgradeLevelDisplay.textContent = upgradeLevel;
    upgradeButton.textContent = `Buy Upgrade (Cost: ${upgradeCost})`;

    if (score < upgradeCost) {
        upgradeButton.disabled = true;
    } else {
        upgradeButton.disabled = false;
    }
}
4. Hover Area Logic
The hover area logic looks good for showing an image and playing sound when hovering over a specific area. You're using mouseenter and mouseleave, which is great.

Suggestion: Just a minor improvement for error handling in case the image or sound elements don't exist or aren't loaded properly. You’re already logging to the console, which is good practice, but you might want to add a more user-friendly approach or default behavior if they aren't found.

javascript
Copy
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    const image = document.getElementById('hiddenImage');
    const sound = document.getElementById('hoverSound');
    const hoverArea = document.getElementById('hoverArea');

    if (hoverArea) {
        hoverArea.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
            if (image) {
                image.style.opacity = '1';
            }
            if (sound && sound.paused) {
                sound.play().catch(err => {
                    console.error("Error playing sound:", err);
                });
            }
        });

        hoverArea.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
            if (image) {
                image.style.opacity = '0';
            }
            if (sound) {
                sound.pause();
                sound.currentTime = 0;
            }
        });
    } else {
        console.log("Hover Area is not found.");
    }
});
5. Miscellaneous Improvements
Global Variables: You have a few global variables like score and clickValue being used in different places. It’s fine as long as they don’t conflict with other scripts, but consider using const or let for more specific scoping if they are only needed in certain functions.

Event Delegation: In case you add more dynamic content to your page, consider using event delegation for the click and hover events. This helps avoid potential issues if elements are added dynamically after the initial page load.

Conclusion
Your JavaScript is functional, but there are a few areas where you can reduce redundancy (like the rock-paper-scissors game), improve error handling, and consider some UI/UX enhancements. The clicker game logic is well-structured, and the hover interaction works well. With just a few tweaks, your code can become even more maintainable and robust.

## Actions
### HTML
- [X] change gb to GB in the lang bit [did it]
- [X] add an author tag [seems pointless personally, but I did it]
- [/] chatgpt doesn't like my title, chatgpt can do one [I ignored this, because it was stupid]
- [/] use a .ico rather than a .png for my favicon [Decided against this one]
- [X] add alt text to the images [maybe the only useful suggestion from chatgpt, it is now done]
- [/] add aria-label to some sections (what does this do???) [no point, just does what semantic tags do]
- [/] use a button rather than regular links for the find out more bits [buttons don't fit the vibe]
- [/] add links to privacy policy or terms of service [I have no terms of service, I think the footer looks fine]
- [/] make sure headings reflect a proper hierarchy [I'm happy with my heading usage]

### CSS
- [/] define the main colours I use into variables so it's easier to update across the entire stylesheet [I did look at this, but I think for what I've got, it just isn't worth it. If I had a bigger website with more stuff then maybe. But I only really use my colours like 3 or 4 times and the tech to set variables in css looks scary]
- [/] chatgpt thinks my font isn't "modern" enough (bleh) [I ignored chatgpt, because it is wrong]
- [/] doesn't like me using a background image and a background colour on the header. Apparently these can conflict if the image doesn't load. Well, like, what if the whole website doesn't load. What then chatgpt?
- [/] use background-size: cover to make sure the image in the header fully covers the header area. I think it will just look stretched out but I guess I'll have a look [I tried what it suggested and it did literally nothing, I don't think it would've looked good anyway, so there]
- [/] add display:flex to the .header class [I did it and it broke something, so nice one chatgpt, you useless frog]
- [/] make sure the logo image size is controlled, otherwise it could stretch if the image isn't resized appropriately [so i tried this and it didn't do anything, I don't really know specifically what it wanted from me anyway]
- [X] add align-items: center to vertically center the nav items (what if i don't want to though??) [I did it, didn't change anything but I did it]
- [X] add a transition to the dropdown menu to make the menu appear smoother [I did it and to be honest I'm not sure I can see any difference]
- [] use a media query to make the page look better on smaller screens (i was like, totally gonna do that already chatgpt. Jeez!)
- [/] doesn't like the background colour on the grid sections because it's too light. I will review [I did indeed review, and found chatgpt to be sniffing it's own bottom]
- [X] add object-fit: cover to ensure images fill their containers without stretching [once again, I did this and it did nothing. Why are you doing this chatgpt? Anyway I left it there because it's doing no harm and maybe it's secretly important somehow in a way that is not visible]
- [/] add padding to the footer [there is padding in the footer!!]
- [] chatgpt doesn't like my styling of the form, this is fair because I literally just started styling the form before this and haven't actually done much of anything with it yet. Low hanging fruit chatgpt!
- [] wants me to use flexbox or position: absolute for shoving the gnome on the right side of the quiz page

### JS
- [] combine the five rps functions (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and spock) into one generalized function by "passing yourPick as an argument" whatever that means. I'll have a look, this does sound like a good idea, I just need to get my head round it
- [] use a more dynamic approach to accessing form values, like storing them in an object or using "querySelector" if the form structure changes
- [] disable the buy upgrade button if the user doesn't have the points to buy an upgrade. I disagree personally, chatgpt can eat slugs
- [X] maybe add something visual that says when the button can or can't be clicked [took ages but I did it]
- [] i have global variables like score and clickValue being used in different places (apparently??). I should consider using const or let for more specific scoping if they are only needed in certain functions (I thought I already did this???)
- [] consider using event delegation for the click and hover events. Helps avoid potential issues if elements are added dynamically after the initial page load
