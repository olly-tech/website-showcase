                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash the goat meat in water with the vinegar and juice from the lime/lemon. Drain away all excess water.</li>
                            <li>In a large enough bowl, season the meat with 1½ tablespoon of curry powder, salt, all-purpose seasoning, pimento, 
                              ginger, scotch bonnet pepper, scallion, onion, and garlic. Drizzle about 2-3 tablespoons of oil over the meat 
                              and rub the seasoning in and leave to marinate for at least 2 hours (overnight is best).</li>
                            <li>Place a pot on medium heat and add about 2 tablespoon of cooking oil and the remaining one tablespoon curry powder.
                              Let the oil heat up (make sure not to burn the curry powder).</li>
                            <li>Add the goat meat and allow it to sear on all sides.</li>
                            <li>Add enough water to the pot to cover the meat. Cover and leave to cook for an hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours or until meat tender.
                              Occasionally, check to make sure enough water is always in the pot.</li>
                            <li>Add the potato and fresh thyme and leave to simmer on low heat until the potato is cooked and sauce is thickened.</li>

                    <div class="instructions-card">
                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Dissect and clean the chicken (remove skin and fat) and wash it in water with vinegar and lime/lemon juice. 
                              Drain away as much excess water from the chicken, dry and chop into small pieces.</li>
                            <li>Season the chicken with the chicken/all-purpose seasoning, ½ tsp of salt and the browning sauce. Add the onion, garlic, scallion,
                              scotch bonnet pepper, thyme, pimento berries, and ginger, or use one ½ tbsp of green seasoning. Rubbing all the ingredients into the 
                              chicken ensures all pieces are well coated. (For maximum flavour, leave to marinate for at least an hour).</li>
                            <li>Separate the onion, thyme, scallion, garlic and pimento from the chicken, which may be painstaking, so don't try to separate every piece. 
                              If you are using the green season, you bypass this step.</li>
                            <li>Heat oil in a large enough pot over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken brown on all sides. Turn the heat down if needed 
                              so the chicken cooks before all sides are brown.</li>
                            <li>Pour away the oil leaving about a tablespoon. Add the water, onion, scallion, garlic, thyme, pimento, scotch bonnet (ingredients you separated earlier),
                              bell pepper, tomato, salt, chicken cube stock and ketchup if you use it. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. (At this point, taste the sauce if flavoured to your liking).</li>
                            <li>Cook for about 10 minutes. Add the chicken. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for another 10 minutes.</li>
