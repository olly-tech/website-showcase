# myfirstwebsite
 
This is the first website i have created on the MadLab intro to web development course

this markdown file will also serve as a place to practice my markdown syntax

# a first level heading
## a second level heading
### a third level heading

**this text is bold** 
*this text is italic*
~this text is strikethrough~
 

>this text is a quote 

to make text appear as code we use `backticks` and it will change the appearance of the contained words 

```triple backticks creates a block of code```
