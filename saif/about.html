                <h2> What we’re about</h2>
                <p>Return is the result of a recognition that over time our daily lives are becoming increasingly busy, and the demands and pace of day-to-day life are increasing year upon year. Where does that leave our mental health, you may ask? In the gutter.

                That’s why we’re here to promote an alternative lifestyle, a slower one. One in which we take the time to relieve our brains of the stresses of modern life and simply just slow down. We hope to achieve this by presenting you with guided opportunities to breathe, these can be found on our <a href="activities.html"> activities</a> page. Whilst also providing you with access to what are called restorative spaces.

                But we’re not just here to preach about the woes of modern life. ‘Return’ is a carefully considered scheme inspired by psychology to help you achieve this healthier way of living.</p>

                <h2> The psychology</h2>
                <p>Return utilises something called Attention Restoration Theory otherwise known as ART. ART was a theory developed in the 1980s, that states that attention is separated into two types. 
                <br>
                Directed/voluntary attention, in essence that stressful task-orientated focus that we’re all too familiar with and the other type being involuntary attention. Involuntary attention is associated with an effortless focus; fascination. 
                <br>
                This effortless focus is something we can often find in nature as there is an abundance of these soft fascinations that the mind requires. Having our brain switch to involuntary attention allows us to recover from the mental fatigue caused by the busyness of our lives.
                <br>
                You may have noticed the pebble on our homepage and the pebble inspired shapes throughout our website and signage. These are our way of bringing these soft fascinations into modern spaces whether they be physically in the city or digitally through our phones.
                <br>
                But the benefits of ART aren’t just limited to green spaces, you can find these benefits in what are called restorative spaces. Restorative spaces can be anywhere as long as they meet certain criteria’s.
